# freeplane-solarized
This provides the solarized tempaltes to be used with freeplane.  These templates follow [Ethan Schoonover's solarized color scheme](http://ethanschoonover.com/solarized).  Two files are provided which enable the dark and light color schemes.  These can be used as is or added as a default template for the user so all new maps have this scheme.  

# Setting as Template
To enable these to be set as default tempaltes, you need to copy the .mm files to the templates folder for freeplane.  For Windows, this is in your user directory similar to the path below.  
  C:\Users\"User"\AppData\Roaming\Freeplane\1.6.x\templates
  
Once there, go to "Tools>Preferences" and select the "Environment" tab.  Under "Files" section, there should be a drop down for "Standard template file".  The copied files should show up in this list.  Once this is complete, any new freeplane map will take on this template.
