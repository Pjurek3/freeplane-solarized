# freeplane-solarized
This provides the solarized tempaltes to be used with freeplane.  These templates follow [Ethan Schoonover's solarized color scheme](http://ethanschoonover.com/solarized).  Two files are provided which enable the dark and light color schemes.  These can be used as is or added as a default template for the user so all new maps have this scheme.
